### Basic motivations for the creation of an OS organisation:
* For the Hydra Specification to be approved we need adoption. Considering the connatural complexity of Semantic Web
technologies, the only way to make Hydra to reach adoption in an ample enough scale is to provide formation about how to
develop REST APIs using Hydra and create proper tools to facilitate this adoption; 
* Formation is by definition time-consuming as much as the subject is complex, for this reason we see a great opportunity in
 leveraging the resources donated by Google Summer of Code or coming from any other possible source of donations.
* Adoption may also be reached by advocating Hydra among companies. It is scope of the Chair to decide which are the fittest
 source according to the objectives.  

Advantages:
* The Open Source landscape is by definition fragmented and many players present themselves to their possible user-base; that
 can be made of single users, companies or other OS organisations. It is important to be properly represented among these by
 planning our public exposure online and through events. 
* The Organisation can realize a consistent representation of the developing efforts of the Community, so that achievements
 and objectives can be clearly represented to the public.
 * The Organisation can be the trend-setter for defining quality standards for official tools. 

Disadvantage:
* Book-keeping
* More responsibilities because of resource allocation
